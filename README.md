# SimpleWebScraper
This is a project written in Python, I'm starting this project to learn this language and to learn the principles of scraping.

I'm working with Visual Studio + Python Tools for Visual Studio so that I can get the advantage of an IDE that I know already and the benefits that the tools provide at the same time.

This project comes from the idea that I had to scrape Kickstarter pages (e.g. kicktraq). I know that are a lot already around the web, but I wanted to do my own in order to learn both Python and scraping.
I want to develop a simple backend that I can use to scrap the website that I want. I will start specifically with kickstarter, but I will eventually expand it if I have time.
